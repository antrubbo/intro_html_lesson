    <h3>This is not, in fact, a "question for the ages." Both Miles and Trane are brilliant in their own right, each contributing to the rich heritage and legacy of jazz music.</h3>

    <p><strong>Miles Dewey Davis III</strong> <em>(May 26, 1926 – September 28, 1991)</em> was an American trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.</p>

    <p><strong>John William Coltrane</strong> <em>(September 23, 1926 – July 17, 1967)</em> was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes and was at the forefront of free jazz.</p>
